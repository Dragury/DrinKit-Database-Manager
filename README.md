# drinKit Database Manager

The new, shiny (not broken) database manager for the mobile drinks app for Team 22 of 2016/17 at Newcastle University!

The new tool is powered by [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/) and will use a RESTful backend powered by either expressjs or flask+python.
